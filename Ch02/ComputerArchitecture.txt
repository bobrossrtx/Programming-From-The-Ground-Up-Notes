Before learning how to program, you need to first understand how a computer
interprets programs.

Modern computer architecture is based off of an architecture called the
Von Neumann architecture, named after it's creator. The Von Neumann architecture
divides the computer into two main parts.
- The CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The Memory
This architecture is used in all modern computers (personal computers,
supercomputers, mainframes, cellphones).

Structure of Computer Memory
----------------------------
To Understand how the computer views memory, imagine your local post office.
They have a room filled with PO Boxes. These boxes are similar to computer
memory, in that each are numberd sequences of fixed-size storage locations.

For example, if you have 256mb of memory, that means your computer contains
roughly 256 million fixed-size storage locations. Or, to use our analogy, 256
million PO Boxes. Each location has a number, and each location as the same,
fixed-length size.

The difference between a PO Box and computer memory is that you can store all
different kinds of things in a PO Box, but you can only store a single number
in a computer memory storage location.

[2208][2209][2210][2211]
[2212][2213][2214][2215]
[2216][2217][2218][2219]
------------------------
Memory locations are like PO Boxes

A computer is organized this way as it is simple to implement. If the computer
were composed of a lot of differently-sized locations, or if you could store
different kinds of data in them, it would be difficult and expensive to implement.

The computer's memory is used for a number ofdifferent things. All of the results
of any calculations are stored in memory. In fact, everything that is "stored" is
stored in memory. Think of your computer at home, and imagine what all is stored
in your computer's memory.

- The location of your cursor on the screen
- The size of each window on the screen
- The shape of each letter of each font being used
- The layout of all the controls on each window
- The graphics for all the toolbar icons
- The text for each error message and dialog box
- The list goes on and on...

The Von Neumann architecture specifies that not only computer data shoud live in
memory, but the programs that control the computer's operations should live there,
too. In fact, in a computer, there is no difference between a program and a
program's data except how it is used by the computer. They are both stored and
accessed the same way.
